# vcf2gds (DNAnexus Platform App)

Converts vcf files to gds using [seqVCF2GDS](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/SeqArray/versions/1.12.5/topics/seqVCF2GDS)

This is the source code for an app that runs on the DNAnexus Platform.
For more information about how to run or modify it, see
https://documentation.dnanexus.com/.

This app is a bit unique in that it runs in a custom docker container which has all of the dependancies
pre installed.
